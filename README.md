# MarvelousMatrices

This is my final project for Linear Algebra that celebrates the capabilities of matrices! The program takes in a matrix from a user and calculates the SVD, QR factorization, inverse, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors when possible. It can also power up a square matrix and represent the matrix as a spectral colormap. It uses the linalg functionalities of the Numpy library.
